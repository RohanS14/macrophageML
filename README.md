This is the code for my summer project on using neural networks for classification of cell type (specifically identifying macrophages) from single-cell RNA sequencing data. We compare the performance of different neural networks and logistic regression. Most tests are run on the dataset <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE115978'>GSE115978</a>. The results are summarized <a href='https://salt-sunspot-21e.notion.site/Results-Updated-ff5c62a04c684eeabb05bea9b8eef459?pvs=4'>here</a>. This project was supported by NIH grant R01AI155696-01 to Debashis Sahoo.
